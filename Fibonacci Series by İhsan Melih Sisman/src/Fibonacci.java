* The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers formed by adding each number with the previous one. In this series, which
*  continues in this way, the golden ratio emerges when the numbers are proportional to each other, that is, when a number
*  is divided by the number before it, a series that approaches the golden ratio is obtained.

The Fibonacci sequence starts from 0 and goes on to infinity. Each digit is added up with the previous digit. The result
*  obtained is written on the right side of the figure. The first ten numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are as follows:
